Ok the thing I notice: All of the edges participate in cycles. Most are in triangles. Some are in squares. The three edges we want to cut are in hexagons. And they're the only edges that are only in hexagons. And 6 is the longest cycle.

So maybe:

Find the shortest cycle for each edge. If there are three with the longest cycles... we win?

Ok so how do we find the shortest cycles for each edge. Could do Dikestra, but allow returning to the starting node. As soon as we do boom. Would have to do it from every node.

I had thoughts!

Weights is overkill. Since edges have no cost and we're just counting them, to get the shortest loop we just fan out until we hit the other end. When we do that's the tightest loop.

We should be able to find _all_ loops through a given node by traversing each edge once. Then we could remove that node, go on to another, and find all loops through it?
